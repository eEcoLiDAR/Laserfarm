Laserfarm (Laserchicken Framework for Applications in Research in Macro-ecology) provides a FOSS wrapper to 
[Laserchicken](https://github.com/eEcoLiDAR/laserchicken) supporting the use of massive LiDAR point cloud data sets for 
macro-ecology, from data preparation to scheduling and execution of distributed processing across a cluster of compute 
nodes.

## Installation

Laserfarm requires the [PDAL](https://pdal.io) and [GDAL](https://gdal.org) libraries and the PDAL Python 
bindings. These packages are most easily installed through `conda` from the `conda-forge` channel:
```shell
conda install pdal python-pdal gdal -c conda-forge
```
Laserfarm can then be downloaded and installed using `pip`:
```shell
pip install laserfarm
```
or using `git` + `pip`:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:eEcoLiDAR/Laserfarm.git
cd Laserfarm
pip install .
```
In order to setup a new conda environment with Laserfarm and all its dependencies, the YAML file provided can be 
employed:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Documentation

The project's full documentation can be found [here](https://laserfarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Applications and Current Limitations

This package has been tested on data provided in a metric-based 2D-projected Cartesian coordinate system, i.e. the 
[Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland](https://www.pdok.nl/introductie/-/article/actueel-hoogtebestand-nederland-ahn3-). 
While some of the tools of Laserfarm could be applied to data in an ellipsoidal latitude/longitude coordinate system 
as well, this has not been tested and it is generally expected to fail.
