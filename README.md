# Laserchicken Macro(-ecology) Pipeline

Laserchicken (LC) is a FOSS tool for extracting statistical properties of subgroups of points from a
(LiDAR) point cloud data set. LC itself is domain agnostic, however one of its main envisaged uses is in
large area remote-sensing, and macro-ecology in particular.

The Laserchicken Macro(-ecology) Pipeline provides a FOSS wrapper to Laserchicken supporting the use of
massive LiDAR point cloud data sets for macro-ecology, from data preparation to sscheduling and execution
of distributed processing across a cluster of compute nodes.
